Computational aid for research in the combinatorics of RNA secondary structures

This formatted Mathematica 10.1.0 notebook provides a visual demonstration of the concepts proven in [“RNA, local moves on plane trees, and transpositions on tableaux”](http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.3056) (Seegerer, Tripp, Tymoczko, and Wang).

When acting on the Young tableau representation of a set of RNA secondary structures, or “plane trees,” sharing the same number of edges, the Weyl group C permutations split these planes trees into two self-contained orbits, one of symmetric plane trees and the other of asymmetric plane trees. The visualization aid summarizes the permutations, Young tableaux, plane trees, and orbits in a layered graph. The visualization aid also gives a few examples of the effects of the Weyl group D permutations, which fail to produce valid orbits and thus are not group actions.
